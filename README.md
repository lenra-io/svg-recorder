# svg-recorder

Record an animated SVG into a video file without uploading anything.

We use the modern browser JavaScript APIs to copy the SVG frames to a canvas and record the result into a video file or zipped image sequence.
It's a static website, without server side.
There is no real SVG upload nor video download.

Find the result online with the Github Pages: https://lenra-io.github.io/svg-recorder/
